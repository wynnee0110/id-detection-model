# Student ID Detection Model

A simple **Student ID detection system** using **OpenCV** and **TensorFlow**.  
The model detects whether a **student ID card is present** in a webcam frame.

## How It Works
1. Capture image from webcam  
2. Resize and normalize the frame  
3. Feed image to trained CNN model  
4. Predict **Student ID** or **No ID**  
5. Display result on screen
